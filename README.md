# Telecommunication-Churn

## 🔍 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry, where retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their usage patterns, service subscriptions, and demographic details. By identifying churn-prone users in advance, telecom companies can design targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze and understand customer behavior through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\
- Select and evaluate multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
- Build a predictive model to classify customers as "Churn" or "No Churn."
- Deploy the model using Streamlit for interactive use.
- Identify key drivers of churn and suggest business insights.
